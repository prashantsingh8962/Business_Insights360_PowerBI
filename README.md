# Business_Insights360_PowerBI

**Project Overview: Business Insights 360**

AtliQ Hardware, experiencing rapid growth, decided to implement Power BI for data analytics to outpace competitors and drive data-informed decisions across finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain. This project addresses critical business questions, enabling stakeholders to make strategic decisions.

**My Role:** I followed the Codebasics Power BI Course, applying skills in SQL, Power BI, Excel, DAX, and DAX Studio to deliver a comprehensive report.

**Key Techniques & Tools:**
- **Data Modeling:** Implemented a Snowflake schema to ensure efficient data organization.
- **DAX Measures:** Created calculated columns and measures, such as dynamic titles and KPI indicators.
- **Visual Design:** Utilized bookmarks, page navigation buttons, and conditional formatting to create an interactive dashboard.
- **Power BI Services:** Published reports, set up data refresh schedules, and managed collaboration and access permissions.
- **Optimization:** Used DAX Studio to fine-tune report performance.

**Company Background:**
AtliQ Hardware, a global seller of computer accessories, recently faced a loss after expanding into the American market based on traditional methods rather than data analytics. Competitors with advanced analytics teams were able to make better decisions, prompting AtliQ to build its own analytics capability to remain competitive.

**Project Kickoff:**
We began by asking crucial questions to define the project’s objectives, success criteria, and potential challenges. Understanding stakeholder expectations and the data needed was vital before diving into the analysis.

**Data Understanding:**
- **Dimension Tables:** Included static data like customer and product details.
- **Fact Tables:** Contained transaction data, such as monthly sales and forecast quantities.

**Dashboard Design:**
The dashboard was designed with various views—Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive—each tailored to address specific business needs. Dynamic features like bookmarks, KPI indicators, and conditional formatting enhanced user experience.

**Outcome:**
The Power BI dashboard provided AtliQ with actionable insights, empowering the company to make informed decisions based on comprehensive data analysis. This project laid the foundation for AtliQ to build a robust analytics team and stay competitive in the industry.

**GitHub and Power BI:**
Learned how to handle large files using GitHub LFS and optimized Power BI reports for better performance.
